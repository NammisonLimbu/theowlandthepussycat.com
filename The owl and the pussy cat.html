<FONT SIZE=23 COLOR="PINK" FACE="Arial"> <b> The Owl and the Pussy Cat </b> </FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Elephant">The Owl and the pussy cat went to sea <BR>
In a beautiful pea-green boat.<BR>
They took some honey and plenty of money <BR>
Wrapped up in a five pound note.<BR> 
The Owl looked up to the stars above.<BR>
And sang to a small guitar.<BR>
"O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,<BR>
What a beautiful pussy you are, <BR>
  You are, <BR>
 You are, <BR>                 
 <IMG SRC="image.jpg" ALT="The owl and the pussy cat" ALIGN="RIGHT"> <BR>
What a beautiful Pussy you are!" <BR>
Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl!<BR>
How charmingly sweet you sing!<BR>
Oh, let us be married! too long we have tarried:<BR>
But what shall we do for a ring?<BR>
They sailed away, for a year and a day,<BR>
To the land where the Bong-Tree grows<BR>
And there in a wood, a Piggy -wig stood,<BR>
With a ring at the end of his nose,<BR>
His nose,<BR>
His nose,<BR>
With a ring at the end of his nose<BR>
"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling<BR>
Your ring?" Said the Piggy, "I will."<BR>
So they took it away, and were married next day<BR>
By the Turkey who lives on the hill.<BR>
They dined on mince, and slices of quinces,<BR>
Which they ate with a runcible spoon;<BR>
And hand in hand, on the endge of the sand,<BR>
They danced by the light of the moon,<BR>
The moon,<BR>
The moon,<BR>
They danced by the light of the moon.<BR> </FONT>
